Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Task Details:
Given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and respresent it visually.

Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Problem Statement:
You have a dataset of Iris flowers with measurements of Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm and Species. 
Your goal is to find the optimal number of clusters in the dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm and then visualize the clusters.

Prediction:
To determine the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset and visualize the results, you can use a common unsupervised machine learning technique 
called the "Elbow Method" with the K-means clustering algorithm.
