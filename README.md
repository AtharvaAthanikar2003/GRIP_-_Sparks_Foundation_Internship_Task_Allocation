1)Task-1:- Prediction using Supervised ML.
  
  Task Details:
  Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
  This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.  
  Dataset - http://bit.ly/w-data  
  Problem Statement:
  What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?
  
2)Task-2:- Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
  
  Task Details:
  Given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and respresent it visually.  
  Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox  
  Problem Statement:
  You have a dataset of Iris flowers with measurements of Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm and Species. 
  Your goal is to find the optimal number of clusters in the dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm and then visualize the clusters.  
  Prediction:
  To determine the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset and visualize the results, you can use a common unsupervised machine learning technique 
  called the "Elbow Method" with the K-means clustering algorithm.

3)Task Details:- Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail.
  
  Task Details:
  Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on dataset 'SampleSuperstore'
  As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
  Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWI 
  Problem Statement:
  What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
  Create dashboards explaining the charts and interpretations.
